# -Brain-Tumor-Classification
A project for developing a system for brain tumor detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification to identify the presence of a tumor (yes/no). Built on this by implementing a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approach to classify tumor types such as glioma and meningioma.
